Hata[45,21]: Symbol 'term scala.collection.parallel.immutable' is missing from the classpath.
This symbol is required by 'tür ParalelDiziYöntemleri.ParDizi'.
Make sure that term immutable is in your classpath and check for conflicting dependencies with `-Ylog-classpath`.
A full rebuild may help if 'ParalelDiziYöntemleri.class' was compiled against an incompatible version of scala.collection.parallel.
(NOTE: It looks like the scala-parallel-collections module is missing; try adding a dependency on "org.scala-lang.modules" : "scala-parallel-collections".
       See https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/ for more information.)
